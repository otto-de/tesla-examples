# A simple example application

This is a very simple application based on [tesla-microservice](https://github.com/otto-de/tesla-microservice). [tesla-httpkit](https://github.com/otto-de/tesla-httpkit) is used as an embedded server, so there are two relevant dependencies:

[de.otto/tesla-microservice "0.1.15"]
[de.otto/tesla-httpkit "0.1.0"]

## Running it
Get [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/#install). Clone the repo. Start the example application with

`$ lein run`

Access the example page under `http://localhost:8080/example`.
